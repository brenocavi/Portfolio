A geologist who is learning a little about data science. I find it fascinating to be able to use geoprocessing tools to see the world in different ways, and how it makes it possible to better understand the world we live in. This makes me want to learn new techniques, such as Machine Learning, Spatial Analysis, Remote Sensing to improve my knowledge and be able to deliver a job with more value.

**Background in:** Python, Geospatial Analysis.
